     -----------------

     For details of lpadmin, see lpadmin(8).


  Using a browser
     CUPS is provided with a CGI for settings so that you can set your printer
     using a browser. To add a printer, follow the steps below.
       Note: The following menu items might differ depending on the CUPS
             version and the environment used.

     (1) Turn on the printer, and please be connected to the PC with a USB cable.
     (2) Connect to CUPS Server (Port: 631) with the browser
         Example: When CUPS is on localhost, access the following URL.
             -----------------
             http://localhost:631/
             -----------------
     (3) Select "Add Printer"
     (4) Enter a printer setting name in "Name", and select "Continue"
          (Other items are not mandatory)
     (5) In "Device", USB, and select "Continue"
         Example: With the EP-901A printer, "Model" is displayed as follows.
             -----------------
             "EP-901A USB #1(EP-901A)"
             -----------------
     (6) In "Model", set "EPSON-ESC/P-R Printer Driver for Linux", and
         select "Add Printer"
         Example: With the EP-901A printer, "Model" is displayed as follows.
             -----------------
             "EPSON EP-901A, EPSON-ESC/P-R Printer Driver for Linux (en,en,ja,nl,fr,de,it,pt,es,ko,zh_CN,zh_TW)"
             -----------------
     (6') Instead of steps (6), specify the PPD file directly from "Browse"
          Example: With the EP-901A printer, you would specify the following file.
              -----------------
              /opt/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr/ppds/EPSON/EPSON-EP-901A-epson-escpr-en.ppd.gz
              -----------------
